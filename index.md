# ShockNet user documentation

## What is ShockNet?

ShockNet is an adjustable economic model for studying how shocks (currently only supply shocks) pass from country to country under certain assumptions. There are a few pieces of terminology to understand first.

- **Producer**: the production of a single sector in a specific country, e.g. the Oil sector of Mexico
- **Importer**: represents the entire import of a specific product into a country, e.g. all of the Textiles imports to Guatemala - in practice you don't see these very much in the app
- **Shock**: currently a supply shock
- **Shock chain**: a chain of shocks that ripple from producers to other producers and possibly onto the countries where the producers are located
- **Critical industry** (of a country): a producer of a country which is significant to the country it is located in, such that if the critical industry experiences a shock, we will consider that it causes a crisis / shock to the country, e.g. if an industry that exports 20% of the country's total exports experiences a shock we might assume that the country will have a crisis

## The basics of ShockNet's model

ShockNet contains data distilled from the [Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) data-base](https://www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/). It bakes this data into a graph model using [TigerGraph Graph DB](https://www.tigergraph.com/) that captures the links between producers, importers, and countries, and the relative importance (% of total) of the various flows and activities. The diagram shows an example of these links.

The fundamental assumption is that if some supply shock comes from a producer, then all other production / imports that take that producer's output might be affected - depending on how important the link is. It allows the user to set thresholds on the scale of flows that will cause a shock to pass from one producer to another, e.g. "assume that if more than 10% of a producer's inputs by value are experiencing a supply shock, then the producer will pass the shock on." [I describe more about the adjustable assumptions later](#setting-model-assumptions)

### Concept: shock transfers

Fundamental to ShockNet is the passing of shocks from one producer to another, and on to create chains of shocks. The question can be reasonably asked, what does this correspond to in the real world?

The model is concerned with supply shocks, assuming this means less of a producer's output will be available (e.g. the harvest of rice fails in some country). It can be fairly assumed that if the total supply (amount available) of a product significantly decreases, then either the price will significantly increase and/or the users of the product will have to reduce their usage of it. If they are not able to substitute some other product (e.g. I can make my food product from wheat rather than rice) then the only way they can reduce usage is to reduce their own production, which then passes along reduced supply to those who use their output.

Since ShockNet is currently a simple model, with no current notion of demand, substitutability, or elasticities, it assumes that a producer receiving a shock (a producer of one of their inputs has produced less, so less is available), they will either lower their production, or pay more for the input and charge more for the output they produce. If they reduce production, then prices will tend to rise for their product, so the outcome is the same and they effectively pass the same type of shock along to those who depend on their outputs under this assumption - the prices of the output become higher.
